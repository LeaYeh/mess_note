Firewall
  - screened host, bastion host, DMZ

- Bastion Host
  - critical strong point of network security.
  - usually: firewall, router, proxy ... etc. 
  - a great deal of effort must be put into designing and configuring bastion hosts 
    - minimize the chances of penetration.

- placement
  - 1 firewall: Bastion host is placed outside the firewall
  - 2 firewalls: between outside firewall and inside firewall, in DMZ.
  
- Security
  - keep it simple
    - Minimum OS, especially rebuild kernel, kernel security patches.
    - Disable or remove any unneeded services or daemons, closing unneed ports.
    - Disable or remove any unneeded user accounts.
    - Disable or remove any unneeded network protocols.
  - security patch of packages, checksum all files.
  - logging, and can use encryption for logging.
  - read-only file system if you can.
  - run IDS(intrusion detection system)

- Hardware
  - less power(CPU?) less attack, but compression and search need power
  - memory for keeping tcp connection
  - cache proxy need large disk

- other keyword for searching
  - inetd + TCP wrapper(tcpd, netacl)

  - security audit, like COP, Tiger, Tripwire
  - monitoring: SWATCH
